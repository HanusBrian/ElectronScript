# HelpTextApp2

This is a project testing Angular 2 with Electron.  The idea is to serve and drop an excel document to be parsed for display and download in a styled htm format.

# Frameworks

This project is using Electron to run this app from the desktop.

Electron is allowing the webframework to work as a desktop app and work with node fs to access the users filesystem to serve, save and take files from the user directly to their desktop.

Basic js, html and css make up the frontend.
